# Small C Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C projects created to
learn and practice low-level programming concepts.

Each directory is a standalone project focusing on specific topics such as:
- memory management
- pointers
- data structures
- file I/O
- CLI tools

The projects are intentionally small and focused.
